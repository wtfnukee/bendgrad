# bendgrad

Have you heard of [Bend](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend)? I didnt before yesterday evening. That is massively parallel, high-level programming language, that just a set of Python style bindings for Rust parallelization bindings.

Have you heard [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)? That is, citing `A tiny scalar-valued autograd engine and a neural net library on top of it with PyTorch-like API`. Sounds cool!

What sound even cooler? micrograd written in two day old language!

Im not sure I wrote it idiomatically and I cant really benchmark it, bc it doesnt even has IO, but Im looking forward to it.
